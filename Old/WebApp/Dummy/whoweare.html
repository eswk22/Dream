            <div class="panel-heading">Operate Services</div>
            <div class="panel-body">RNAM Operate Services has ongoing business and operations with Sprint, AT&T, Verizon, T-Mobile and key web players. Operate Services has solution offerings to touch every customer segment in North America and we are currently engaged in discussions with almost all of them. To grow Operate Services and reach our $2B vision by 2020 we are implementing different business models and new service solutions according to customer needs. These business models are specific to the customer and are made up of services and solutions such as Managed Security, Energy Management and Operational Excellence.</div>

    <div class="panel panel-default">
            <div class="panel-heading">Our Growth Strategy </div>
            <div class="panel-body">Operate Services growth is a big part of RNAM’s growth strategy. Operate Services has an ambition and opportunity to become a $2B business by 2020 in North America alone. In North America, most customers are self-managing their networks. We believe that as our customers (operators, web players, cable and utility companies, government agencies, etc.) go through a transformation to Cloud, Software Defined Networking (SDN) or Network Function Virtualization (NFV) technology they will look for a partner such as Ericsson to do the transformation and manage their network’s Key Performance Indicators (KPI’s) and Service Level Agreements (SLA). The market’s competitive pressure and unlimited data plans are putting heavy strains on operators financials which is generating a good business opportunity for Operate Services to support our customers to reduce operational costs while still driving performance improvements through the outsourcing of their network and services operation.</div>
    </div>


    <div class="panel panel-default">
            <div class="panel-heading">Customer Transformation </div>
            <div class="panel-body">The way operators manage their networks will be completely transformed due to virtualization. This transformation is happening as the customer’s base is changing from handsets, setup boxes or specific user devices to a whole new world of connected devices, M2M etc. The industry model is changing more towards a XAAS model (X As A Service) meaning our Operator customers will only pay for what they use, which will put more pressure on them to have efficient, scalable and reliable networks to operate. We have a huge growth potential for Operate Services in the next 5-10 years.
